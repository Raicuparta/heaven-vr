HeavenVR is a VR mod for [Neon White](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1533420/Neon_White/), with full motion control support.

[![Raicuparta's VR mods](https://raicuparta.com/img/badge.svg)](https://raicuparta.com)

Features
--------

*   6DOF stereo VR camera.
*   Motion controls.
*   Smooth and snap turning.
*   Handedness options.
*   Adds weapon models (the base game didn't have them).
*   Optionally shows an animated player body (mostly useful for recording with LIV).
*   Options for fine-tuning the VR controls.
*   Upload scores to VR-specific leaderboards (Steam only).

How to Install
--------------

[Get HeavenVR on itch.io](https://raicuparta.itch.io/heaven-vr). I recommend using the [**itch.io app**](https://itch.io/app) to install the mod, so that you can get automatic mod updates.

Run `RaiManager.exe` (or click Open in the itch.io app) and follow the instructions in the installer.

Make sure you have the correct OpenXR runtime selected (Oculus, SteamVR, or WMR). If you're using a Quest and connect it to the PC using official wired Link or wireless AirLink, you need to set Oculus as your OpenXR runtime. If you're using a Quest with Virtual Desktop, you need SteamVR as your OpenXR runtime. Go to the settings for SteamVR / Oculus to find where to make them your default OpenXR runtime.

Leaderboards
------------
I didn't want the high scores you get in the VR version to mix with the official leaderboads used in the flat game, since that could be considered cheating. It's unlikely that VR players get high scores more easily, but it's possible that the VR features allow for some strats that are impossible in the flat version.

If you own the game on Steam, your high scores get uploaded to VR-specific leaderboards, so you can compete with other people playing with this mod.

If you own the game on "PC Xbox" / Game Pass / Microsoft Store, then leaderboards just get disabled completely.

Requirements
------------

*   A legitimate and up to date PC version of Neon White. Currently supports:
    *   [Steam Version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1533420/Neon_White/).
    *   [Windows Store / Game Pass / "Xbox PC" version](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MTGVHF37DFK). <sub><sub>(jfc microsoft please fix your product names I never know how to refer to games on your god foresaken store)</sub></sub>
*   A PC ready for PCVR.
*   An OpenXR-compatible VR headset. Examples:
    *   Meta Quest (1 / 2 / 3 / Pro / whatever) connected to a PC via Link Cable, Air Link, Virtual Desktop, ALVR, etc
    *   Rift/Rift S
    *   Valve Index
    *   Any VIVE
    *   Any Windows Mixed Reality device (probably?)
*   VR controllers. This isn't playable with a normal game controller, motion controls are required.

How to Uninstall
----------------

Start the installer again (by starting RaiManager.exe or clicking Open in the itch.io app), and click the uninstall button. You won't lose any game files, and it won't affect your progress.
